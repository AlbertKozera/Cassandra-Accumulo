### Cassandra-Accumulo CRUD Console App - Zoo

This repository contains a simple **Zoo** console application for demonstrating CRUD operations using two distributed NoSQL databases: **Apache Cassandra** and **Apache Accumulo**. The app serves as a learning tool.

## Features
- Perform CRUD operations on zoo data using Apache Cassandra's wide-column store.
- Perform CRUD operations on zoo data using Apache Accumulo's sorted key-value store.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Cassandra server + Java Driver
- Apache Accumulo server + Java Driver

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Start either the Apache Cassandra or Accumulo server locally, or configure their IP and port in the source code.
3. Run the desired CRUD operations in the console.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations in Apache Cassandra and Apache Accumulo.
- Understand the architecture and use cases of distributed NoSQL databases.
